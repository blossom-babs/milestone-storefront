## Endpoints
1. GET /books
> returns an array of the books object in the database
2. POST /books
> saves new book to the database and returns the book object
> Request should be made in the format below👇
```
{
  "title": "mas querido",
  "author": "Blossom Babalola",
  "total_pages": 400,
  "category": "non-fiction, auto-biography",
  "summary": "An auto-biography of a life lived for Christ"
}
```
3. PUT /books/:id
> Edit the details of the book with requested id. Note: put is used, not patch, therefore the query expects the entire book object 
4. DELETE /students/:id
> deletes the book with the requested id from the database. Returns same book object
5. GET /students/:id
> returns an object of the book that matches the requested id
